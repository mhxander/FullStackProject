School Database app

This full-stack javascript app uses REST API and React to allow teachers at our fictional school to add and edit courses, but only if they are authorized to do so.

To start, there are a few steps:

For the back-end API:
1. Using the terminal of your choice, navigate to the API folder.
2. Type "npm install" to install all dependencies needed to run the app.
3. Type "npm run seed" to seed our SQLite database.
4. Type "npm start" to start the database, so it can be accessible to the front end of the app.  Leave this running in the terminal.

For the front-end site:
5. Navigate to the client folder.
6. Type "npm install" to install dependencies for the front end.
7. Type "npm start" to start the front-end application.
8. Go to your browser(preferably Google Chrome), and browse to the URL http://localhost:5000/ .  This should display the site, and allow you to experience the site in its entirety.
